    <h1>MLB Hit Distance Compare & Visualizer</h1>
    <p> The MLB Distance Tracker is a tool that shows where a ball landed in a real MLB game, and can be used to show
        where it would have landed at a different stadium. Using Statcast data and MLB stadium assets, the distance
        tracker is a useful tool for any baseball fan.

    <p style="margin: 3vw !important; margin-top: 3vh !important;">  To load a new hit, click the "New Hit" button. On the next screen, type in part of the player's name who hit the ball, and select from the pool of players in the select on the right. <strong> If you do not select a player, no data will load. This will be improved later.</strong> After selecting stadium (optional), outcome (optional), and year, wait for the data to load. You can select from a list of past hits and outs. Click an outcome and wait a moment for the stadium to load.  <strong>If no data loads, that means no search results matched your parameters.</strong> You should now see the hit with the stadium it took place in. <strong>Please note, stadium effects like elevation are not accounted for at the moment. An updated version is in the works.</strong>
        
        Switching stadiums is powerful because it lets you see if the ball might have been a homerun in other ballparks. When switching stadiums, please wait 3-10 seconds for the large stadium files to load. <strong>Please note, Toronto's Rodger's Centre does not have updated dimensions for the 2024 season. This will be updated eventually.</strong> Historic stadiums like Crosley Field and Old Yankee Stadium will be added in the future, however, they likely will not be as detailed as previous stadiums. Also, it would be cool to add in old dimensions of existing stadiums, like the deep Tal's Hill at Minute Maid Park.
